      <p>Despite Republicans holding the reigns of both houses of Congress, the White House and many state governments, several early signs point to the possibility of a “blue wave” that could sweep Democrats back into power across the country this November.</p>

      <p>Could such a phenomenon wash over Minnesota this election cycle?</p>

      <p>Examining previous midterm backlashes, along with demographic and polling trends, suggests that the answer could be yes. And if those indicators hold out, the DFL might have many reasons to celebrate on Election Night.</p>

      <p>Historically, the generic ballot has been fairly predictive of outcomes in midterm elections, and Democrats at this time have an edge similar to the one Republicans had in their 2010 wave.</p>
      
      <p>Time will tell if Democrats can maintain this moment and how accurate these polls may be this cycle.</p>

      <p>Additonally, a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/democrats-big-minnesota-trump-approval-sags-n918681">recent NBC News/Marist poll of likely voters</a> showed similar trends with Sen. Amy Klobuchar leading (DFL) leading Jim Newburger (R) for the U.S. Senate race, Sen. Tina Smith (DFL) leading Karin Housley (R) in U.S. Senate special election and Tim Walz (DFL) leading Jeff Johnson (R) in the gubernatorial contest.</p>

      <p>Winning big statewide races tends to provide momentum for candidates further down the ballot, generating a coattails effect in congressional and legislative contests.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Democrats lead the "enthusiasm gap"</h2>
      <p>For the past couple years, Democrats have gradually regained ground in off-year and special elections across the country, including major upset victories in Republican areas once thought to be secure. This has signaled an increase in Democratic energy and voter engagement.</p>

      <p>While Minnesota hasn't seen a special election the last couple years, past midterm election results reveal some ways to measure voter enthusiasm.</p>

      <p>Most Minnesota congressional districts see some kind of bump for the opposition party during midterm elections, which is often accompanied by a boost in voter turnout, something sometimes referred to as the "enthusiasm gap."</p>

    <p>Maps of Minnesota precincts — shaded by whether the <span class="d4 legendary">DFL</span> or <span class="r4 legendary">GOP</span> saw an increased vote share compared to the the previous presidential election — reveal what these kinds of waves have looked like in the past.</p>

    <p>Significant numbers of precincts have seen increased vote shares for the minority party in three of the past four midterm elections — with the election following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks being the sole exception.</p>

    <p>Whether Democrats can continue this trend of minority party resurgence remains to be seen.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Low presidential popularity</h2>
      <p>While President Trump isn't on this year's ballot, in many ways midterm elections are referudums on presidential job performance.</p>

      <p>Because of this, the president's party usually loses seats on state and federal levels, and how many seems partially tied to approval ratings. Presidents with an approval rating under 50 percent tend to suffer the greatest midterm losses.</p>
