      <p>Despite Republicans holding the reigns of both houses of Congress, the White House and many state governments, several early signs point to the possibility of a "blue wave" that could sweep Democrats back into power across the country this election cycle.</p>

      <p><a href="http://static.startribune.com/news/projects-staging/all/20181027-redwave/">Republicans do have some factors favoring them</a> too, so a Democratic sweep isn't a given.</p>

      <p>But Minnesota could be primed for big Democratic wins at the ballot box, as suggested by historical midterm trends and recent polling in the state's biggest and hottest races.</p>

      <p>On a national level, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/">aggregated estimates of the generic Congressional ballot</a> – which simply asks people which party they would prefer to vote for – has consistently given <span class="d4 legendary">Democrats</span> an advantage over <span class="r3 legendary">Republicans</span> among likely voters for months.</p>

      <p>As of Oct. 30, 2018, registered and likely voters preferred Democrats over Republicans by about 8 points.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Democrats are more enthusiastic</h2>
      <p>For the past couple years, Democrats have gradually regained ground in off-year and special elections across the country, including major upset victories in Republican areas once thought to be secure. This has signaled an increase in Democratic energy and voter engagement.</p>

      <p>While Minnesota hasn't had a notable special election the last couple years, previous midterm results show what voter enthusiasm bumps look like in Congressional districts.</p>

      <p>Maps of Minnesota precincts — shaded by whether the <span class='d4 legendary'>DFL</span> or <span class='r3 legendary'>GOP</span> saw an increased vote share compared to the the previous presidential election — reveal what these kinds of waves have looked like in the past.</p>

    <p>Significant numbers of precincts have seen increased vote shares for the minority party in three of the past four midterm elections — with the election following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks being the sole exception.</p>

    <p>But that 2002 election was also one of the few in American history where the sitting president's party didn't lose ground in Congress, making it an outlier compared to others years. By contrast, the 2018 midterm appears to be following the usual patterns.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Low presidential popularity</h2>
      <p>While President Trump isn't on this year's ballot, in many ways midterm elections are referudums on presidential job performance.</p>

      <p>Because of this, the president's party usually loses seats on state and federal levels, and how many flip seems partially tied to approval ratings. Presidents with an approval rating under 50 percent tend to suffer the greatest midterm losses.</p>
